# Customer Segmentation

## Project Overview
This project implements a customer segmentation system using K-means clustering to group customers based on their annual income and spending patterns. The implementation provides valuable insights for targeted marketing strategies.

## Technical Details

### Implementation
The project utilizes Python with essential data science libraries:
```python
import numpy as np
import pandas as pd
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import seaborn as sns
from sklearn.cluster import KMeans
```

### Features
- Automated customer grouping using K-means clustering
- Visual representation of customer segments
- Optimal cluster determination using elbow method
- Comprehensive data analysis capabilities
- Interactive visualization support

### Analysis Components
The system performs several key analyses:
1. Data preprocessing and validation
2. Feature selection and scaling
3. Optimal cluster determination
4. Segment visualization and analysis

## Usage Instructions

### Setup
1. Install required dependencies:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

2. Execute the segmentation analysis:
```bash
python customer_segmentation.py
```

### Data Requirements
Input data should be provided in CSV format with columns for:
- Customer ID
- Annual Income
- Spending Score
- Additional demographic information (optional)

## Visualization
The system generates several visualizations:
- Elbow curve for optimal cluster determination
- Scatter plots of customer segments
- Cluster centroid visualization
- Distribution analysis plots

## Business Applications
The segmentation results can be used for:
- Targeted marketing campaigns
- Customer behavior analysis
- Product recommendation systems
- Strategic business planning

## Future Enhancements
Planned improvements include:
- Additional clustering algorithms
- Enhanced visualization options
- Real-time data processing
- API integration capabilities
